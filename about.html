        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Mizba Khan, a top-performing computer science student from Jain Institute of Technology with a passion for coding and a commitment to innovation. Throughout my academic career, I have excelled in programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML and CSS, and have developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. I am a quick learner, a problem solver, and a team player, always eager to tackle new challenges and create solutions that make a real impact.

            I am particularly interested in web development, Artificial Intelligence & machine learning, Data Science, and UI/UX Designing, and I am excited about the potential for these technologies to transform industries and improve people's lives. In my free time, I enjoy practicing Prayers, taking photographs, cooking, and reading fictional novels. My long-term career goal is to become a software developer or Data Scientist at a forward-thinking technology company, where I can leverage my skills in programming, mathematics, and data analysis to drive innovation and create value for users. I believe that my strong academic background, passion for learning, and commitment to excellence make me an ideal candidate for this role.</p> </section2></div>
